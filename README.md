Project Objectives

    Identify top-performing customers and products by analyzing net sales and growth trends.
    Evaluate market performance by comparing net sales against sales targets and analyzing deviations across key regions.
    Assess financial health by examining key metrics, such as gross margin, gross margin percentage, and cost of goods sold (COGS).
    Provide actionable insights for improving cost control, enhancing profitability, and strengthening AtliQ’s market strategy.

4. Financial Health and Profitability

    Monthly Profit & Loss (P&L) statement analysis covering net sales, COGS, gross margin (GM), and gross margin percentage (GM%) for each fiscal year.
    Highlights:
        Net Sales: Increased significantly from $87.5M in 2019 to $598.9M in 2021.
        Gross Margin: Although net sales grew, GM% declined, reflecting increased COGS.
        Cost Control: Rising COGS as a percentage of net sales highlights potential cost concerns.

5. Gross Margin % Analysis by Quarter

    Regional GM% breakdown for key regions (e.g., India, North America, ANZ) from 2019 to 2021.
    Key Insights:
        Declining GM% in India and ANZ indicates a need for cost optimization.
        Stable GM% in ROA and NE regions suggests steady profitability.

# Insights and Recommendations

    Cost Control: Focus on reducing operational inefficiencies, especially in India and ANZ, to improve GM%.
    Maximize High-Growth Months: Increase promotions during peak months, such as December, to capitalize on high sales periods.
